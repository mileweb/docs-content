# Creating a New Certificate

There are two ways to create a new certificate: 

1. **Auto-generate a self-signed certificate**. Use this method if you need a certificate signing request (CSR) to apply for a certificate from a certificate authority (CA). You can then download the CSR of the new self-signed certificate and submit it to the CA. When you receive the CA-signed certificate and chain certificate(s), you can upload them as a new version.

2. **Upload the private key, certificate, and chain certificate(s)**.

## Auto-Generating a Self-Signed Certificate 

The following procedure describes how to generate self-signed certificates. Self-signed certificates can be used for testing purposes or internal use before deploying the certificate into the production environment. If you need a CSR to obtain a signed certificate from a CA, create a self-signed certificate first.

1. In the left pane, click **Certificates**.
2. At the top right of the Certificates page, click the **Create Certificate** button.

4. Click the **Save Certificate** button followed by **OK**.

Your certificate is saved and appears on the Certificates page. You can now use the certificate with any properties you create, and deploy it to staging and production environments. You can also download the CSR to apply for a signed certificate from a CA, and then upload it to create a [new version](</docs/portal/certificates/updating-certificates.md>) of this certificate.

## Uploading an Existing Certificate

If you already have a certificate with the private key and the CA chain certificate, you can upload them so they can be used by properties. Before performing the following procedure, make sure the certificate and associated files are in Privacy Enhanced Mail (**PEM**) format. The files' content should be plain text and begins with five equals signs (`=====`).

To upload the files as a new certificate:

1. In the left pane, click **Certificates**.<br>
2. At the top right of the Certificates page, click the **Create Certificate** button.

4. Click the **Save Certificate** button followed by **OK**. 

Your certificate is saved and can now be used with any properties you create.
